# YelpReviewELT

## Intro
Data source: [Kaggle Yelp Recruiting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recruiting)

Extract reviews from *yelp_training_set_review.json* on a cluster with Hadoop MapReduce and tag each review with its associated stars and a label describing it is a positive review (star > 3) or not.

## Run
The codes are written and complied in Eclipse.
Therefore, import the whole project if need further modification.
Hadoop Commands:
```
$ bin/hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hzhu/input
$ bin/hadoop fs -put yelp_training_set_review.json input
$ bin/hadoop jar ReviewExtraction.jar ReviewExtraction.ReviewExtraction input output
$ bin/hadoop fs -get output ./
$ bin/hadoop fs -cat output/*
$ bin/hadoop fs -rm -R output
```

## Sample input and output

## Asides
1. Virtual box and Ubuntu installation http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox
2. Hadoop installation: https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html  
`$ jps # check if nodes are running` http://www.bogotobogo.com/Linux/hadoop2_running_on_ubuntu_single_node_cluster.php  
Permission denied problem when running _start-dfs.sh_  http://serverfault.com/questions/544917/pdsh-gives-error-rcmd-socket-permission-denied/775914
3. Share folder with VirtualBox http://askubuntu.com/a/679916 (only need to add user group then reboot)
4. Import library into eclipse http://stackoverflow.com/a/4962584  
A better practice is using Maven project and add corresponding dependencies in pom file. This allows downloading dependent libraries automatically.
5. Work with Hadoop in Eclipse  
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4058155/how-can-i-compile-a-java-program-in-eclipse-without-running-it  
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15188042/where-are-hadoop-jar-files-in-hadoop-2/15202099#15202099
6. A mysterious problem: the jar file packed by Eclipse in MacOS cannot be resolved by hadoop jar command. Instead I need to work in a Linux system. Also, the jar file packed in a Linux system cannot be unzipped in my MacOS. Hence I guess it's probably the problem with the difference of compression algorithms used between MacOS and Linux.
